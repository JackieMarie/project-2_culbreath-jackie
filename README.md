# Project 2 - Part 3

### Resources
I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

### Deductions
I have reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

### Comments
For Part 3, I added my html files, started the navigation, added images, and added navigation to the footer. I am behind due to a work situation where I had to cover for someone unexpectedly and work a lot of extra hours the last week. Hope to catch up by this coming weekend.
