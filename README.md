# Project 2 - Part 5

### Resources

- [Flexbox in CSS](https://cssreference.io/flexbox/)

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

- [CSS Grid Layout Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV8B24rSN5o&t=1330s): This really helped with positioning my about page grid. Need to go back and tweak the grid on my index page.

- [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

- [Hamburger Menu](https://codepen.io/createlyn/pen/xJYmZx): Used this for my hamburger menu, but my links do not work on mobile. I think maybe the Backstretch plugin I am using for section beneath the header is causing this but am not sure.

- Ducket, J. (2014). *Javascript & JQuery: interactive front-end web development.* Indianapolis, IN: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.: Used the book as reference to code JQuery event.

- [W3C Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/): Used this site to help me with my JQuery code.


##### Plugins
- [Backstretch](http://www.jquery-backstretch.com/): Used this plugin for the background image of my entire Contact page. I also used it on images in a `.landing` section of both my Home and About pages.

- [ScrollUp](https://markgoodyear.com/2013/01/scrollup-jquery-plugin/): This plugin was applied to all of my pages. As soon as a user starts to scroll down, this appears in the lower, left corner.

- I also used loaded in a smoothscroll.js file that I used on a past project. There is a link in the opening paragraph on my Home page that users can click and it will scroll down to the Call-To-Action section at the bottom to download the app.

### Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

### Comments
I am about finished with my site. I need to tweak the Home page grid, review my code, and also try to get the links in the hamburger menu to work!
