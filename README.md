# Project 2 - Part 3

### Resources
I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

### Deductions
I have reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

### Comments
For Part 3, I added my html files, started the navigation, added images, and added navigation to the footer. I am behind due to a work situation where I had to cover for someone unexpectedly and work a lot of extra hours the last week. Hope to catch up by this coming weekend.

### Comments
For Part 4, I finished formatting my Contact page, except the buttons. Having some problems with placement. Also, added content to the Home page. Still trying to get the modal to work and place it in the nav bar.
